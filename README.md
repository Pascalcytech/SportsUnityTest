# SportsUnityTest
Technical test required by SportsUnity :

Project was developped with the IDE Eclipse.

H2 was used rather than a HashMap as requested.
Tests are conducted thanks to the JUnit FrameWork.
Tests shows that the API is functionning correctly.

Can be compiled in an autonomous Jar that does not require a pre-installed container/server.

TaskController is entirely commented because it is not useful anymore but I kept it if I ever need to go back.
